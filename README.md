Machine Learning Specialization

This course has been completed on Coursera offered by University of Washington. In this specialization we have implemented different algorithms from the core in python. We have covered different areas of Machine Learning including Prediction, Classification, Clustering, and Information Retrieval. 

Also developed, analyzed large and complex datasets, created systems that adapt and improve over time, and build intelligent applications that can make predictions from data. 

The codes have written in Jupyter notebook.

The course has been categorized majorly in Regression, Classification, Document & Information Retrieval techniques and case studies. Navigate more deep into git repository to see for detailed studies.
